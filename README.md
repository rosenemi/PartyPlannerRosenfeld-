# PartyPlannerRosenfeld-
AP CS Project 

The task of this project was to create a thing that would sort guests of a party into table groups that would pick them up and prevent peopple from the same company from sitting together. We also needed it to be able to add new guests and allow users to look up the roster of certain tables and companies as well as find indiviual people by name.

I struggled coming up with how to build this project at first. Orignally, I was trying to use ArrayList but it became too complicated and complex so I had to researt. I instead decided to create an array of the guests (who were all objects call People) and a 2D array for each seat at each table. This worked fairly well and simplified the process signifcantly. I create an add method as well as the printing roster and printing company method very quickly. 

Uploading the data ended up being easier than I expected and I had few issues. The most signifcant was that I need to split the guests name by first and last so that the split method used to split up the data worked correctly.

I had the most diffculty with the sort method.
